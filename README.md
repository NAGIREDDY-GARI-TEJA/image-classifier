- 👋 Hi, I’m @NAGIREDDY GARI TEJA
- 👀 This project is an image classifier built using deep learning techniques to classify images into different categories.
- 🌱 It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. 
- 💞️ The classifier can be trained on a dataset of images and then used to predict the categories of new unseen images.
